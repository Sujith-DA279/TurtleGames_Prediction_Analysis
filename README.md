# Turtle Games : Predicting Future Outcomes

### üìã Project Brief
I conducted an in-depth analysis of Turtle Games customer data to improve overall sales performance through enhanced understanding of customer behavior and loyalty patterns. Using Python, R, and advanced statistical methods, I delivered actionable insights that can drive enhanced marketing effectiveness, customer retention, and targeted product offerings to increase revenue.

### ‚úÖ Objectives
The analysis addressed key business needs of
- Understanding customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
- Identifying key factors influencing customer loyalty.
- Developing predictive models to forecast future sales.

They were addressed through multiple advanced data techniques: 
- **Customer Loyalty Drivers Analysis**: Applied **linear regression** modeling to identify and quantify key factors influencing customer loyalty
- **Customer Segmentation**: Implemented **decision tree** and **K-means clustering** to develop behavior-driven customer personas
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilized **NLP techniques (VADER, TextBlob)** on 2,000 customer reviews to assess product satisfaction
- **Integrated Recommendation System**: Combined quantitative insights with sentiment analysis to create segment-specific strategies

### üéØ Key Findings & Business Impact
The analysis revealed significant opportunities for enhanced customer engagement through strategic loyalty program redesign and targeted marketing. Spending score and remuneration emerged as *primary loyalty drivers* (**correlation scores of 0.67 and 0.62**), while *five distinct customer segments* were identified with significantly different loyalty behaviors (ranging from 275 to 3988 average loyalty points).

**Data-Driven Recommendations:**
- Implement a tiered loyalty program with differentiated benefits based on five identified customer segments
- Deploy predictive loyalty model to anticipate customer behavior and tailor marketing approaches
- Enhance product quality and gameplay mechanics based on sentiment analysis findings
- Develop targeted strategies for "Occasional Affluents" with high income but inconsistent spending patterns

### üóùÔ∏è Key Insights:

**Loyalty Drivers Analysis**
- Identified **spending score** (0.67) and **remuneration** (0.62) as strongest predictors of customer loyalty
- Determined that age has a weak negative correlation (-0.04) with loyalty points but remains statistically significant
- Developed robust **Weighted Least Squares** regression model explaining **82.1%** of loyalty point variance
- Created **predictive formula: Loyalty Points = -1944.89 + 31.87 √ó Spending Score + 31.39 √ó Remuneration + 10.57 √ó Age**
> [!IMPORTANT]
